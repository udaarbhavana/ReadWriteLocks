/* Problem 2 : Implement a custom Read-Write Lock in Java requires managing the synchronization between reader and
               writer threads. The key requirements are:
         Multiple reader threads can access the resource concurrently.
         Only one writer thread can access the resource at a time.
         Writer threads must wait until all reader threads have finished before they
        can proceed.
         Reader threads must wait if there is a writer thread writing or waiting to
        write.
*/

/* The goal of the program is to demonstrate how multiple threads (readers and writers) interact with a shared resource
  (s) using synchronization mechanisms (ReentrantLock and mutex) to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
*/

/* Shared Variable (s): This is the integer variable that both readers and writers access. Writers can modify (add)
   to this variable, while readers can only read its current value.
